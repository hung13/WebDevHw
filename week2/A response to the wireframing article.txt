A response to the wireframing article

A UX architect's most important skill is beyond problem solving; it is communicating - the ability to clearly articulate between clients, developers, and managers to ensure smooth and efficient workflow.  I was surprised UX stresses more on communication and teamwork than UI.  I have never had a clear distinction between the two fields; though I am not sure if I completely comprehend the differences and similarities.  Aguilar describes UX architects as informaton gatherers and client-developer mediators to effectively achieve customer satisfaction but does not stress about programming (which I now assume is the job of UI developers).  Wireframing seems to be the only non-interpersonal skill of UX.  So is that the clear distinction between UI and UX?  A quick research indicates that UX is more involved in the analytical and techinical side to optimize users' experiences with companies.  UI is similar to graphic designers, implimenting designs to complement the presentation and interactivity of products.
