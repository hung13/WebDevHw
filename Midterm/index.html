				&nbsp &nbsp NYU is and always has been at the forefront of innovation and this is the standard we are maintaining with <span class="strong">NYU Tandon Motorsports</span>. From the start of this endeavor, we have utilized advanced materials and innovative techniques of fabrication in order to create the best possible vehicle. Even with these cutting-edge technologies we have made sure to work through multiple iterations to maximize utility and design. <span class="strong">With this as our inaugural year</span>, we are also given a distinct ability to create our design without the restraints of past exhibitions.

			<h3 class="grid_12 prefix_2">NYU Tandon Motorsports is a <span class="strong">vehicle for change</span>.</h3>
			<h4 class="grid_12">
				&nbsp &nbsp From the start we have been an inclusive engineering organization focused on creating an offroad vehicle, but with additional interests from students, faculty, and sponsors, allow us to be a social mentor. As a team we have attended Women in Engineering events, STEM in education, and internal open houses in order to increase interest in the sciences and engineering through our project. <span class="strong">Moving forward</span> we will continue to remain steadfast in our endeavor of creating social change.

					&nbsp &nbsp Baja SAE is an <span class="strong">intercollegiate competition</span> pitting teams against each other with the objective of designing and constructing the best off-road vehicle.
				</h4>

				<h4 class="grid_4">
					At its heart, Baja SAE is a competition in which <span class="strong">multiple fields of engineering</span> are tapped in order to create the most realistic automotive challenge.
				</h4>
				<h4 class="grid_4 omega">
					&nbsp &nbsp Each team participating is required to create an <span class="strong">off-road vehicle</span> that would survive the severe punishment of rough terrain with minimal cost in an effort to gain a contract for 4000 units.
				</h4>

			<h4 class="description grid_12 prefix_2">
				&nbsp &nbsp Although this competition is focused towards colleges, this event stems from the <span class="strong">Baja 1000</span> event that occurs annually. In 1962, on 950 miles of rocks, sand washes, cattle crossings, and paved road, Baja found its humble beginnings. What began as a simple test of the reliability of an off-road vehicle became an international phenomenon and with each passing year since it has gained popularity. Nearly 16 years later, Baja SAE began and instantly created a <span class="strong">large intercollegiate event</span> bringing teams from across the nation and eventually the world.
